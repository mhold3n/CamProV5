# Numerical Precision Requirements for CamProV5

## Overview

This document establishes the numerical precision requirements for the CamProV5 project, specifically focusing on the mathematical equivalence between the Python and Rust implementations of the motion law. These requirements are a critical component of Phase 1 (Parameter Validation) of the CamProV5 implementation strategy.

## Precision Requirements

The following error margins are established for the different kinematic quantities:

| Quantity | Maximum Allowed Error | Unit |
|----------|------------------------|------|
| Displacement | 1.0 × 10⁻¹⁰ | mm |
| Velocity | 1.0 × 10⁻⁸ | mm/s |
| Acceleration | 1.0 × 10⁻⁶ | mm/s² |
| Jerk | 1.0 × 10⁻⁴ | mm/s³ |

These error margins represent the maximum allowed absolute difference between the Python and Rust implementations for any given input angle.

## Rationale

### Displacement Precision (1.0 × 10⁻¹⁰ mm)

The displacement precision is set at 0.1 nanometers (1.0 × 10⁻¹⁰ m), which is:
- Approximately 1000 times smaller than the diameter of a hydrogen atom
- Far below the manufacturing tolerances of any physical cam system
- Sufficient to ensure that numerical errors do not propagate significantly in FEA calculations

This extremely high precision ensures that the Rust implementation faithfully reproduces the Python design model at a level that exceeds any practical physical requirements.

### Velocity Precision (1.0 × 10⁻⁸ mm/s)

The velocity precision is set at 10 nanometers per second, which:
- Is below the detection threshold of any physical measurement system
- Ensures that velocity-dependent forces in the FEA model are accurately calculated
- Prevents accumulation of errors in time-dependent simulations

### Acceleration Precision (1.0 × 10⁻⁶ mm/s²)

The acceleration precision is set at 1 micrometer per second squared, which:
- Is orders of magnitude below the acceleration noise floor in physical systems
- Ensures accurate calculation of inertial forces in the FEA model
- Provides sufficient precision for stress and strain calculations

### Jerk Precision (1.0 × 10⁻⁴ mm/s³)

The jerk precision is set at 0.1 millimeters per second cubed, which:
- Is sufficient for accurate vibration analysis
- Ensures smooth motion profiles without discontinuities
- Prevents numerical artifacts in higher-order derivatives

## Implementation Considerations

### Floating-Point Representation

Both implementations use 64-bit floating-point numbers (double precision in C/Rust, float64 in Python/NumPy), which provide approximately 15-17 significant decimal digits of precision. This is more than sufficient for the precision requirements established above.

### Algorithmic Differences

Small differences between the Python and Rust implementations may arise due to:
- Different implementations of mathematical functions (sin, cos, etc.)
- Different order of operations in floating-point calculations
- Different compiler optimizations

These differences are expected to be well within the established error margins.

### Validation Testing

The parameter validation test suite (`test_parameter_validation.py`) verifies that the Python and Rust implementations meet these precision requirements by:
1. Running both implementations with identical input parameters
2. Comparing the results for a range of input angles (0-360 degrees)
3. Calculating the maximum absolute difference for each kinematic quantity
4. Verifying that the differences are within the established error margins

## Conclusion

The numerical precision requirements established in this document ensure that the Rust implementation of the motion law is mathematically equivalent to the Python implementation within error margins that are far below any practical physical requirements. This equivalence is critical for the success of the CamProV5 project, as it allows engineers to design and optimize cam profiles in Python with confidence that the Rust FEA engine will faithfully reproduce their designs.

These requirements satisfy the "Establishing numerical precision requirements" component of Phase 1 of the CamProV5 implementation strategy.
