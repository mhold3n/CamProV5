# Gradle Wrapper Fix

## Issue Description

The Gradle wrapper in the CamProV5 project was not functioning correctly, resulting in the following error when attempting to run Gradle commands:

```
Error: Could not find or load main class org.gradle.wrapper.GradleWrapperMain
```

## Root Cause

Upon investigation, it was discovered that the `gradle-wrapper.jar` file was missing from the `gradle/wrapper` directory. This JAR file contains the `org.gradle.wrapper.GradleWrapperMain` class that is required for the Gradle wrapper to function.

The `gradle-wrapper.properties` file was present and correctly configured to use Gradle version 7.5.1, but without the JAR file, the wrapper could not operate.

This issue was also documented in the project's `KOTLIN_UI_IMPLEMENTATION.md` file, which noted: "The gradle-wrapper.jar file is missing and would need to be downloaded in a real setup".

## Solution

The issue was resolved by copying the `gradle-wrapper.jar` file from the CamProV4 project to the CamProV5 project's `gradle/wrapper` directory.

### Steps Taken:

1. Verified that the `gradle-wrapper.jar` file was missing from the CamProV5 project
2. Identified that the CamProV5 project was configured to use Gradle 7.5.1
3. Located a `gradle-wrapper.jar` file in the CamProV4 project
4. Noted that CamProV4 uses Gradle 8.14.2, which is a different version than CamProV5
5. Copied the JAR file from CamProV4 to CamProV5 despite the version difference
6. Verified that the Gradle wrapper now works correctly by running `.\gradlew --version`

### Verification:

After copying the JAR file, the Gradle wrapper successfully downloaded Gradle 7.5.1 and displayed the version information:

```
Welcome to Gradle 7.5.1!
Here are the highlights of this release:
 - Support for Java 18
 - Support for building with Groovy 4
 - Much more responsive continuous builds
 - Improved diagnostics for dependency resolution

Gradle 7.5.1

Build time:   2022-08-05 21:17:56 UTC
Revision:     d1daa0cbf1a0103000b71484e1dbfe096e095918
Kotlin:       1.6.21
Groovy:       3.0.10
Ant:          Apache Ant(TM) version 1.10.11 compiled on July 10 2021

OS:           Windows 11 10.0 amd64
```

When running the original command `.\gradlew :desktop:run`, the Gradle wrapper now starts correctly, though a separate build configuration issue was encountered related to plugin resolution. This is unrelated to the wrapper functionality and would need to be addressed separately.

## Conclusion

The Gradle wrapper is now functioning correctly. The fix was simple but effective - providing the missing `gradle-wrapper.jar` file. This allows the project to use Gradle commands via the wrapper without requiring a global Gradle installation.

## Future Recommendations

1. Include the `gradle-wrapper.jar` file in version control to prevent this issue from recurring
2. Add a note in the repository documentation about the importance of the Gradle wrapper files
3. Consider updating the Gradle wrapper to a more recent version if needed for compatibility with newer plugins
