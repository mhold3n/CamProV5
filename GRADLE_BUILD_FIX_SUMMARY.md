# Gradle Build Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed

This document summarizes the changes made to fix the Gradle build issues in the CamProV5 project. The main issues were:

1. Performance issues in the EventSystem, causing the `testEventPerformance()` test to fail
2. State persistence issues in the AnnotationManager, causing test failures in `AnnotationManagerTest`
3. Similar state persistence issues in ComparisonManager and SharingManager
4. Event propagation issues in SharingManagerTest

## Changes Made

### 1. EventSystem Improvements

The following improvements were made to the `EventSystem` class:

1. **Enhanced Buffer Configuration**
   - Increased the replay cache from 10 to 16 for late subscribers
   - Increased the buffer capacity from 1000 to 4000 for high-volume event processing

2. **Optimized Coroutine Context**
   - Changed from `Dispatchers.Default` to `SupervisorJob() + Dispatchers.IO + CoroutineName("EventSystem")`
   - Added necessary imports for `SupervisorJob` and `CoroutineName`

3. **Added Batch Event Processing**
   - Implemented the `emitBatch()` method to efficiently process multiple events as a batch
   - Groups events by type for more efficient processing
   - Emits events in a single coroutine for each type

4. **Added Optimized Event Collection**
   - Implemented the `collectEvents()` method for more efficient event collection
   - Returns a Job that can be cancelled to stop collection

### 2. State Persistence Fixes

The following fixes were made to ensure clean state between tests:

1. **AnnotationManager**
   - Added `resetState()` method to reset all state variables
   - Resets annotations, active session, annotation events, and filters

2. **ComparisonManager**
   - Added `resetState()` method to reset all state variables
   - Resets active comparisons, comparison state, and events

3. **SharingManager**
   - Added `resetState()` method to reset all state variables
   - Resets sharing state, active shares, and collaboration sessions

### 3. Test Improvements

The following improvements were made to the tests:

1. **ComparisonManagerTest**
   - Fixed the `test comparison with missing parameters` test to correctly test for removed parameters
   - Split the test into two separate comparisons: one to check for removed parameters and another to check for added parameters

2. **SharingManagerTest**
   - Changed the `sharingEvents` flow from a `MutableStateFlow<SharingEvent?>` to a `MutableSharedFlow<SharingEvent>` to ensure that all events are collected
   - Modified the `emitEvent` method to use `tryEmit` and `emit` instead of setting the flow's value
   - Updated the test to handle non-nullable events and ensure that the collection is established before proceeding with the test
   - Added extensive debug logging to help diagnose any issues
   - Added missing imports for `CompletableDeferred` and `Collections`

### 4. Event Propagation Improvements

The following improvements were made to ensure reliable event propagation:

1. **SharingManager**
   - Changed the `sharingEvents` flow from a `MutableStateFlow<SharingEvent?>` to a `MutableSharedFlow<SharingEvent>` with a replay cache of 10 and an extra buffer capacity of 100
   - Modified the `emitEvent` method to use `tryEmit` for non-blocking emission, with a fallback to suspending emission if needed
   - Added debug logging to print emitted events

2. **SharingManagerTest**
   - Used a synchronized list to store events, which is thread-safe and avoids potential concurrency issues
   - Used a `CompletableDeferred` to track when the collector is ready, ensuring that the test doesn't proceed until the collector is established
   - Added extensive debug logging to help diagnose any issues

## Verification

The fixes were verified by running the Gradle build, which successfully completed with all tests passing. The build output confirmed that:

1. All compilation errors were fixed
2. All tests passed, including the previously failing tests in EventSystemTest, ComparisonManagerTest, and SharingManagerTest

## Conclusion

The Gradle build issues in the CamProV5 project have been successfully fixed. The changes improve the performance and reliability of the event system, fix the state persistence issues in the manager classes, and ensure reliable event propagation in the tests.

These improvements make the codebase more robust and maintainable, and ensure that the tests are reliable and consistent.
