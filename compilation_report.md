# Compilation and Testing Report

## Tasks Completed

1. **Native Libraries Compilation** ✓
   - Compiled the fea-engine Rust project in release mode
   - Generated fea_engine.dll successfully

2. **Library Deployment** ✓
   - Copied the compiled library as campro_motion.dll
   - Copied the compiled library as campro_fea.dll
   - Placed both in the correct resource directory

3. **Core Application Compilation** ✓
   - Fixed type mismatch in MotionLawEngine.kt
   - Successfully built the application with Gradle

4. **Exploratory Testing** ✓
   - Ran start_exploratory_testing.ps1 successfully
   - Testing session completed with meaningful data capture

## Details

### Native Library Compilation
The Rust source code was located in `D:\Development\engine\CamProV5\camprofw\rust\fea-engine`. 
Compilation was done using `cargo build --release`, which produced `fea_engine.dll`.

### Library Deployment
The compiled library was copied to:
```
D:\Development\engine\CamProV5\desktop\src\main\resources\native\windows\x86_64\campro_motion.dll
D:\Development\engine\CamProV5\desktop\src\main\resources\native\windows\x86_64\campro_fea.dll
```

### Core Application Compilation
Fixed a type mismatch in MotionLawEngine.kt by converting Float values to Double:
```kotlin
// Original code with error
val rodAngle = Math.atan2(pistonDiameter / 2 - followerX, rodLength)

// Fixed code
val rodAngle = Math.atan2((pistonDiameter / 2 - followerX).toDouble(), rodLength.toDouble())
```

### Testing Results
The exploratory testing script ran successfully and generated session data with UI component states.
The session data file confirms that all components were properly initialized and monitored.

## Conclusion
All requirements from the issue description have been successfully completed.
